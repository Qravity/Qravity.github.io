                            themes of my research. My primary research interest lies in making statistical inference
                            based on the analysis of data from a wide range of observations that span from sub-nanoscale
                            physical system to larger structures in science and technology. Use of machine intelligence
                            and the latest computing technologies in my research and development enable large-scale modeling
                            and visualization that often lead to amazing insightful understandings.
